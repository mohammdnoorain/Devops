Ansible Controller Master Node Configuration and Installation

The Ansible Controller package is designed to simplify the setup and configuration of an Ansible master node, enabling you to efficiently manage and automate configurations on target machines. This package automates key tasks required to configure and manage your target nodes seamlessly.
Installation and Setup Instructions:

Follow the steps below to install and configure the Ansible controller package on your system:
Step 1: Switch to Root User

To ensure proper installation permissions, begin by switching to the root user:

sudo -i

Step 2: Update Package Manager

Next, update your package manager to ensure all dependencies are up-to-date:

sudo apt update

Step 3: Install python3-pip

To manage Python packages, install pip, the Python package installer:

sudo apt install python3-pip

Step 4: Install the Ansible Controller Package

Once pip is installed, use it to install the ansible-controller package:

pip install ansible-controller

Step 5: Run the Package

After installation, run the package by simply executing the following command:

ansible_controller

Step 6: Provide New User Details

You'll be prompted to enter the name of the new user that will be created on your machine. This user will be used to manage and interact with the target machine(s).
Step 7: Define Inventory Group

Next, provide a name for the inventory group. This group will help categorize and manage your target machines. You can choose any group name you prefer.
Step 8: Specify Target Machine Name

You will then be asked to provide the name of the target machine you want to configure. This can be any name you'd like.
Step 9: Enter Private IP of the Target Machine

Provide the private IP address of the target machine to establish a connection between the controller and the node.
Step 10: Provide Target Machine Username

Enter the username of the target machine. This is the username that the controller will use to authenticate and configure the target machine.
Step 11: Save the Public Key

Finally, the package will provide a public key that you need to save. This key will be used when running the Ansible target machine setup package to allow secure communication between your master node and the target nodes.
Conclusion:

The Ansible Controller package streamlines the configuration process for managing your infrastructure with Ansible. By following the steps outlined above, you will have a fully configured Ansible master node ready to automate tasks across your network of target machines. Use this package to enhance productivity and simplify Ansible node management for your IT infrastructure.
